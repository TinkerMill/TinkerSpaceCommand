Tinkermill Space Command

TinkerMill Space Command is a space automation framework designed for the
TinkerMill Maker Space in Longmont, CO. 

The framework uses IoT (Internet of Things) technologies for sensing, command,
and control of the physical space. Though the framework will be implemented
for the needs of the TinkerMill space, it will be implemented as a plugin
based framework that will make it easy to add in new functionality.

The project consists of a central server and code for implementing Space Nodes,
which can contain both sensors and provide control of the physical space.
Libraries that make it easy to add to the framework will be provided.
These will include Python modules, arduino libraries, etc. The primary
implementation languages will be Python, C, and probably some
avascript/Typescript for user interfaces.

Full documentation for the platform, including message formats, circuit
diagrams, and more can be found on the TinkerMill wiki.

This platform is open source with an Apache 2 license.

The project was started by Keith Hughes and Steve Lammers, but will hopefully
have code contributed by anyone interested in being part of the project.
